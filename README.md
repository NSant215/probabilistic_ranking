# probabilistic_ranking
Code to explore learnings in probabilistic ranking methods using match data of top tennis players.

This project outlines code to solidify learnings on how different rankings methods work, by conducting investigations on a dataset of 1801 matches played between the top 107 male tennis players in 2011. 

The first investigation is on Gibbs Sampling. The complex distribution we want to sample from is the outcome of a game between two players. In this task, we are trying to predict the outcome of matches by sampling from a developing skill matrix.
